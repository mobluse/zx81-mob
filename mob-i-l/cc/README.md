These games come from [_More BASIC Computer Games_](http://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/) edited
by David H. Ahl (AKA David Ahl), published 1979, and where ported from Microsoft (BASIC-80 for CP/M?) to ZX81 BASIC 
in 1982-1983. Since there are a lot of differences between BASIC-80 and ZX81 BASIC it was rather difficult to port them.
